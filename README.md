# OnlineShopping project
I used Entity Framework Core (Code First approach) and Windows Form to create this project.
You can login as an admin or user. If you are a user, you can see your orders on the customer page. Then, from this page, you can go to another page where you can order products. Here is the product list. You can select the product id in the combo box, write the number of the product you want to buy, and show the image of the product. Then click the Add to Cart button. This product will go to the cart displayed in the datagridview. You can also buy multiple products and these products are collected as a list in the cart. Then when you order, this product list will be updated in both the database and datagridview. Otherwise, if you log in as an admin, you can add, update, delete products, and download files. Also, the admin can see users' orders: Order history, Customer ID, and Status. Status describes the activity of the product. Admin can change the status to inform the user.
